# ðŸª„ SwiftUI Magic: Advanced Techniques for Complex Interfaces.
##### by Tyler Johnson & Paul Himes for Minnebar 17 April 22nd 2023

SwiftUI has revolutionized the way developers create user interfaces for Appleâ€™s platforms. Its declarative API makes it fast and simple to build most common UI designs. However, as applications become more complex, developers may find themselves fighting the system to create truly unique and dynamic interfaces.

In this talk, we covered some of the techniques weâ€™ve used in our projects to achieve custom UI designs. We used animation to add whimsy, implemented custom view alignment, created a new layout container, responded dynamically to user interaction, and improved navigation with custom transitions. With these tools youâ€™ll be able to confidently tackle many types of custom interfaces in your SwiftUI apps.

### Bubble Animation
Add whimsy with animated profile bubbles.

### Custom Alignment and Layout
Align views to a custom vertical postion.

### Sticky Footer
Read and respond to the frames of SwiftUI Views to create a footer label that sticks to the bottom of the screen.

### Custom Transition
Add a custom animated transition when navigating between screens.
